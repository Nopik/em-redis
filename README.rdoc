== EM-REDIS

== DESCRIPTION:

An EventMachine[http://rubyeventmachine.com/] based library for interacting with the very cool Redis[http://code.google.com/p/redis/] data store by Salvatore 'antirez' Sanfilippo.
Modeled after eventmachine's implementation of the memcached protocol, and influenced by Ezra Zygmuntowicz's {redis-rb}[http://github.com/ezmobius/redis-rb/tree/master] library (distributed as part of Redis).

This library is only useful when used as part of an application that relies on
Event Machine's event loop.  It implements an EM-based client protocol, which
leverages the non-blocking nature of the EM interface to acheive significant
parallelization without threads.

WARNING: this library is my first attempt to write an evented client protocol,
and isn't currently used in production anywhere.  All that bit in the license
about not being warranted to work for any particular purpose really applies.


== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Implements most Redis commands (see {the list of available commands here}[http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/CommandReference] with the notable
exception of MONITOR and AUTH 

== TODO:

* Right now method names are identical to Redis command names.  I'll add some nice aliases soon.
* I'm sure multibulk responses can be handled more elegantly 
* Better default error handling?  Provide a default response block?

== SYNOPSIS:

* Like any Deferrable eventmachine-based protocol implementation, using EM-Redis involves making calls and passing blocks that serve as callbacks when
the call returns.  

  require 'em-redis'

  EM.run do
    redis = EM::Protocols::Redis.connect("localhost", 6379)
    error_callback = lambda {|code| puts "Error code: #{code}" }
    redis.on_error &error_callback
    redis.set "a", "foo" do |response|
      redis.get "a" do |response|
        puts response
      end
    end
  end

* To run live tests on a Redis server (currently compatible with 0.91)
  
  rake redis:live_test

* To run a test of the underlying protocol implemention

  rake redis:offline_test

Because the EM::Protocol::Memcached code used Bacon for testing, test code is
currently in the form of bacon specs.  I'll port them to RSpec at some point.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Redis (download[http://code.google.com/p/redis/downloads/list])

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install em-redis --source http://gemcutter.org
